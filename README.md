# My Game code for : Gamedev.js Jam 2025 (April 13th to 26th 2025)

Theme : Balance

## Progress :

### Day 1 (2025-04-18) Log :

I basically set up the environment for creating the game.
I've never done serious HTML5 game development before, so I had to get used to how this all works.
I decided to use the Phaser API, since my game doesnt really need any fancy physics for the moment really and the Phaser API already permits a lot.


For the game itself, here's what I've done (or tried) so far :

- I setup the page around the project so that it looks nice and the overall visuals are ok for now.

- The game now has a main menu and a game scene. The main menu is very basic for now and the game scene doesn't have much visually yet.

- I have a system of accounts working good. I just need a way to add some buttons to that, but for now, just incrementing the values suffice to test out ideas.

- So far I have a Checking Account and a High-Yields Savings Account type of deal going on.

- I still need to figure out how to color the rectangle strokes to make some kind of border effect around the account texts.
